# Chameleon

### Description

Chameleon is a bare minimum internal skin changer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Only the absolute essential classes and methods are implemented.

### Notes

Original owner is _not_ checked, if you pick up someones weapon and a full update is performed, it will turn into the skin you have defined in `Skins.h` regardless of if it belongs to you or not.

### Usage

Define your skins in `Skins.h`, compile and inject into the game process.
